# stone-paper-scissor-game
in this we have created a stone paper scissor game in which we also added the 2 rounds winner out of three will win the game 
we used random, emoji{} filling inside the columns such as "a":"emoji" means depicted emoji
we also used print(f"score - YOU:{user_score}, computer{computer_score}") to shorten up the code of normal print function
